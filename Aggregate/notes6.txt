The aggregate method takes an array and it takes an array because we define a series of steps that should be run on our data. The first step will receive the entire data right from the collection you could say and the next step can then do something with the data returned by the first step and so on.

in aggregate framework we basically add pipelines step by step whose inpus is based on output of previous pipeline 
for eg . match , group , sort , project etc can be used together by creating new pipelines

it will not change the original data



The $project stage in MongoDB aggregation pipeline is used to pass along the documents with the requested fields, add new fields or reset existing fields, or exclude fields1

The unwind stage is always a great stage when you have an array of which you want to pull out the elements.
